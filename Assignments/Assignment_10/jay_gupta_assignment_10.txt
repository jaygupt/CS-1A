A queue is a data type in Java. It is different from stacks, in that stacks retrieve the
last item put in first, also known as LIFO (last in, first out). A queue, on the other 
hand, retrieves the first item put in it, which is known as FIFO (first in, first out). 

A queue, like an array, can hold any data type, and is usually meant to process the data 
later, in some way. It is very similar to stacks, in that it offers methods to 
remove an item (pop for stacks, poll for queues), add an item (push, or add), 
or to see the next item in the list (element, or peek).

A real-life example is a supermarket-queue, where you take your groceries and pay for them: 
the first person in line gets checked out first, followed by the next person in line, etc. One
can't just skip to the front of a line, and get checked out first; the order goes first person, first 
out, second person, second person out, etc. This is similar to how queues work in 
Java: the first element inserted gets handled first.

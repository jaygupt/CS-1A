1) The difference between the do-while and while loop is in the order by 
which the condition is tested in. In the while loop, the condition is 
tested at the beginning. If the condition is true, the statements in the 
loop are tested. 
This is in stark contrast to do-while: the condition is tested at the end 
of the loop. This allows for the statements to be executed at least once, 
even if the condition isn't met. 

Example (while) (Source Code): 

public class Question_One {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      int num = 0;

      while (num < 5) {
         System.out.println("The number is: " + num);
         num++;
      }
   }
}

Example (Output): 

The number is: 0
The number is: 1
The number is: 2
The number is: 3
The number is: 4

Example (Explanation): 

Here we have a while loop that checks if 'num' is less than 5. If it 
is, it prints out the number, and increments num by 1. When num becomes 
5, 5 is not less than 5, and the condition fails. That is why it stops
at 4. 

Example (do-while) (Source Code): 

public class Question_One {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      int num = 0;

      do {
         System.out.println("The number is: " + num);
         num++;
      } while (num > 5); 
   }
}

Example (Output): 

The number is: 0

Example (Explanation): 

In this example, num is set to 0, and a do-while is used. The 
statements are executed once, and since 1 is not greater than 5, 
the do-while loop breaks. If this were a while loop (while (num > 5))
the statements would have never run, not even once.

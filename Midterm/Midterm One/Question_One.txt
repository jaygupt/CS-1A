1 a) Post increment operation

Example: 

Source Code: 
public class Main{
     public static void main(String []args){
        int number1 = 3; 
        int number2 = 5; 
        
        System.out.println("number1 is equal to: " + number1++); 
        System.out.println("number2 is equal to: " + number2++); 
        
        System.out.println("\nnumber1 is NOW equal to: " + number1); 
        System.out.println("number2 is NOW equal to: " + number2); 
     }
}

Output: 
number1 is equal to: 3
number2 is equal to: 5

number1 is NOW equal to: 4
number2 is NOW equal to: 6

As we see in the example, number1 and number2 are initially set to 3 and 5, respectively. The first
print statements print them out, with the post increment operator, but it prints their initial values, 
and after, increments them by 1. That is why, in the next set of print statements, we see their values incremented
by 1. 

b) Pre decrement operation

Example: 

Source Code: 
public class Main{
     public static void main(String []args){
        int number1 = 3; 
        int number2 = 5; 
        
        System.out.println("number1 is equal to: " + --number1); 
        System.out.println("number2 is equal to: " + --number2); 
     }
}

Output: 
number1 is equal to: 2
number2 is equal to: 4

As we see in the example, number1 and number2 are initially set to 3 and 5, respectively. The 
print statements print them out with the pre decrement operators, and it first decreases each by 1, and then prints
them out. These values are immediately returned, unlike the post increment operators, which return the values
only after the print statements were executed.
